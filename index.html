Reason: By definition from Newton's Second Law (F=ma), the unit of force is kg⋅m/s², which is designated as 1 Newton (N).

3.A body is said to be in equilibrium when:
A. It is at rest only B. The resultant force is maximum C. The resultant force is zero ✅ D. The acceleration is maximum
Reason: Equilibrium, whether static or dynamic, signifies a state where the net (resultant) force acting on the body is zero (∑F=0).

Reason: Density is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the volume it occupies: (ρ=m/V).

6.The slope of a velocity–time graph gives:
A. Acceleration ✅ B. Speed C. Distance D. Displacement
Reason: The slope represents the rate of change of velocity with respect to time (Δv/Δt), which is the definition of acceleration.

7.Which of the following materials is a good conductor of electricity?
A. Plastic B. Copper ✅ C. Rubber D. Wood
Reason: Copper is a metal with a high concentration of free electrons, which facilitates the easy flow of electric charge.

When a body moves in a circular path at constant speed, it experiences:
A. Gravitational force B. Rotational force C. Centripetal force ✅ D. Centrifugal force
Reason: The centripetal force is the internal, centre-seeking force required to maintain circular motion by constantly changing the body's direction (velocity).

An image formed by a plane mirror is always:
A. Virtual and upright ✅ B. Real and inverted C. Diminished D. Magnified
Reason: An image formed by a plane mirror cannot be projected onto a screen (virtual), is the same height, and is upright.

The pressure at a point in a liquid increases with:
A. Altitude B. Depth ✅ C. Temperature D. Volume
Reason: Fluid pressure is given by P=ρgh. Therefore, pressure increases linearly with depth (h).

A stone and a feather will fall at the same rate in:
A. A vacuum ✅ B. Air C. Water D. Oil
Reason: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance, ensuring all objects fall under gravity with the same constant acceleration, regardless of mass.

The energy stored in a stretched spring is:
A. Kinetic energy B. Potential energy ✅ C. Electrical energy D. Thermal energy
Reason: Energy stored due to the change in shape (or position) is potential energy; in this case, elastic potential energy.

Which of these quantities has both magnitude and direction?
A. Work B. Energy C. Force ✅ D. Pressure
Reason: Force requires both a magnitude (how large the push/pull is) and a direction for its complete description, making it a vector quantity.

When a substance changes from solid to gas directly, the process is called:
A. Condensation B. Evaporation C. Sublimation ✅ D. Fusion
Reason: The phase transition from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase is called sublimation (e.g., solid carbon dioxide/dry ice).

The instrument used to measure temperature is called:

Reason: A thermometer is the standard apparatus for measuring temperature, often relying on the thermal expansion of a liquid.

What happens to the volume of a gas when pressure increases at constant temperature?

Reason: Boyle’s Law states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, pressure is inversely proportional to volume (P∝1/V).


Which of the following pairs are both vectors?
A. Work and power B. Momentum and force ✅ C. Speed and acceleration D. Pressure and energy
Reason: Both momentum (p=mv) and force (F=ma) are vector quantities, requiring direction. (Speed, Pressure, and Energy are scalar).

A ball is thrown vertically upward and returns to the hand 3.0 s later. Find its initial velocity (g=10 m/s²).
A. 15 m/s ✅ B. 30 m/s C. 10 m/s D. 7.5 m/s
Reason: The time taken to reach the maximum height is tup=½ttotal=½(3.0s)=1.5s. At maximum height, the final velocity (v) is 0 m/s. Using the equation v=u+at: 0=u+(−10 m/s²)(1.5s). Thus, u=15 m/s.

The area under a graph plotting force against displacement represents:
A. Work done ✅ B. Momentum C. Energy lost D. Kinetic energy
Reason: Since Work done is calculated as Force × Displacement (W=F⋅d), the area under the F−d graph gives the Work done.

A. 90 kW ✅ B. 180 kW C. 300 kW D. 900 kW
Reason: Power is P=Work/Time. Work done is the change in Kinetic Energy: W=ΔKE=½m(v²−u²)=½(1000 kg)((30 m/s)²−0)=450,000 J. Thus, P=W/t=450,000J/5.0s=90,000 W=90 kW.

A. 2.25×10⁸ m/s ✅ B. 4.0×10⁸ m/s C. 1.5×10⁸ m/s D. 3.0×10⁸ m/s
Reason: Refractive Index (n) is defined as n=c/v. v=c/n=3.0×10⁸ m/s÷(4/3)=2.25×10⁸ m/s.

Two resistors, 6 Ω and 12 Ω, are connected in parallel. Determine the effective resistance.
A. 4 Ω ✅ B. 18 Ω C. 0.25 Ω D. 3 Ω
Reason: For parallel connection: 1/Reff=1/R₁+1/R₂=1/6+1/12=3/12=¼. Hence, Reff=4 Ω.

When the temperature of a gas increases, what happens to the average kinetic energy of its molecules?
A. Decreases B. Increases ✅ C. Remains constant D. Becomes zero
Reason: The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute (Kelvin) temperature of the gas (KEavg∝T).

A metre rule is found to balance at the 40 cm mark when a mass of 50 g is suspended from the 10 cm mark. Calculate the weight of the rule.
A. 20 g B. 30 g C. 50 g D. 75 g ✅
Reason: The weight (W) of the rule acts at the centre of gravity (the 50 cm mark). By the Principle of Moments: W×(50−40)=50×(40−10)⟹W×10=50×30⟹W=150 g. The chosen answer D (75 g) corresponds to half this value, possibly due to question modification. Kept unchanged as instructed.

If an object moves with uniform velocity, its acceleration is:
A. Zero ✅ B. Constant C. Infinite D. Negative
Reason: Uniform velocity means the velocity is not changing (Δv=0). Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, it must be zero.

Which electromagnetic wave possesses the shortest wavelength?
A. X-rays B. Gamma rays ✅ C. Infrared D. Ultraviolet
Reason: On the electromagnetic spectrum, Gamma rays are at the high-frequency, high-energy end, corresponding to the shortest wavelengths.

If the North Pole of a permanent magnet repels one end of a solenoid, what is the magnetic polarity of that solenoid end?
A. North pole ✅ B. South pole C. No pole D. Induced pole
Reason: The law of magnetism states that like poles repel. If North is repelled, the solenoid end must also be a North pole.

A. 400 J ✅ B. 225 J C. 375 J D. 450 J
Reason: Efficiency η=Output/Input×100%. Input=Output/η=300 J/0.75=400 J.

A. 1.0×10¹⁵ Hz ✅ B. 4.4×10¹⁵ Hz C. 1.0×10⁻¹⁵ Hz D. 4.4×10⁻¹⁵ Hz
Reason: Threshold frequency f₀=W₀/h=6.63×10⁻¹⁹/6.63×10⁻³⁴=1.0×10¹⁵ Hz.

A. 4.0 m/s ✅ B. 6.0 m/s C. 8.0 m/s D. 2.0 m/s
Reason: By the conservation of momentum: (2×12)+(4×0)=(2+4)v⟹v=24/6=4.0 m/s.

Total Internal Reflection (TIR) is a phenomenon that occurs when light travels from:
A. A denser medium to a rarer medium ✅ B. A rarer medium to a denser medium C. Vacuum to glass D. Air to diamond
Reason: TIR requires the angle of incidence to exceed the critical angle, which is only possible when light moves from a denser to a rarer medium.

The sound of thunder is always heard a noticeable period after the lightning flash is seen because:
A. Sound travels faster than light B. Both travel at the same speed C. Light travels significantly faster than sound ✅ D. Sound and light are waves of the same nature
Reason: Light travels at 3.0×10⁸ m/s, while sound travels at approximately 340 m/s. The vast difference in speeds accounts for the time delay.

A. 40 V ✅ B. 1000 V C. 20 V D. 400 V
Reason: Using Vs/Vp=Ns/Np, Vs=Vp×(Ns/Np)=200×(80/400)=40 V.

Which instrument is primarily used to accurately compare the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of two battery cells?
A. Potentiometer ✅ B. Galvanometer C. Voltmeter D. Wheatstone bridge
Reason: The Potentiometer measures e.m.f. under the null condition, ensuring zero current, thus an accurate comparison.
